# Bevypunk - Bevy AoUI

This is a fork of [IDEDARY](https://github.com/IDEDARY)'s awsome Bevypunk project,
recreateed using bevy-aoui and bevy-aoui-widgets.

The key difference is AoUI is not a web based layout crate, therefore although the project looks fine
when scaled in desktop resolution, it will not look as good in mobile resoluton compared to the original.

Huge thanks for the project template and assets.
